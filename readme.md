In task 7 was implemented calculation the probability of the number's sum on two dice by Monte-Carlo method. If the results of Monte-Carlo calculations compare with results of analytical calculations, it can be clearly seen that experiment with small amount of random dice rolls shows that value is the farest from the value calculated by analytical method (the difference can be even more than 10%). While experiment with large amount of random dice rolls shows that value is only slightly different from the "real" value (difference less then 1%).
So, it can be concluded that the more random dice rolls are generated for Monte-Carlo method, the more accurate value returns, but the result can vary time to time because of randomness.
